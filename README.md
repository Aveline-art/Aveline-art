# Hello, world!

My name is Ava, and I am a hands-on developer with React, Django and Docker experience. A self-starter and problem solver, I excel at picking up new technologies and systems to meet project requirements and improve existing systems.

As Technical Lead, my philosophy is to deliver a product as efficiently and correctly as possible. Thus, I value tools, strategies, and procedures that increase development velocity, remove roadblocks in workflow pipelines, and effective communication with multidisciplinary software teams.

Outside of software development work, I enjoy talking about the art of coding. Topics I love include low-level topics, such as data structures or machine learning algorithms, and high-level topics, such as Design System componentization, optimal configurations for development vs production environments, and effective ways of documenting code.

## Projects

**CivicTechJobs** [Repo](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs)

A content management system that uses a research-based filtering system to optimally match volunteer opportunity seekers to projects. Made with a team of skilled developers, project managers, UI designers, and UX researchers, this project is the crystallization of months of research and development. I have had the luxury of being the Technical Lead involved with developing its technical stack and architectural design.

**CivicTechJobs-Documentation** [Site](https://aveline-art.github.io/CivicTechJobs-Documentation/) | [Repo](https://github.com/Aveline-art/CivicTechJobs-Documentation)

The sister project to CivicTechJobs, CivicTechJobs-Documentation is a static website that organizes documentation in the [CivicTechJobs wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki). Unaffiliated with CivicTechJobs, this website started an exploration of MKDoc's features and suitability as a documentation tool and alternative to GitHub's wiki.

**penrose-sweets** [Repo](https://github.com/Aveline-art/penrose-sweets)

A command line tool that leverages url-based libraries to build weekly grocery lists for busy developers! The program intelligently parses ingredient lists from popular food blogs and compiles them into a single grocery list. It also leverages a JSON file to cache previously parsed recipes (memoization). My final project for Harvard's CS50x, penrose-sweets explored ways of leveraging Python's object-oriented design to simplify and organize complex code.

**GHA-add-issue-to-project** [Repo](https://github.com/100Automations/GHA-add-issue-to-project)

A GitHub action that performs GitHub issue management based on a single configuration file. Made for non-technical project managers, the automation uses a custom language interpreter to parse high-level syntax based on the Python language. The goal of this project is to simplify the Kanban board organization, freeing time and energy for project managers to focus on project strategizing and organization.
